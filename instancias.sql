INSERT into color values ("red","Haste, Firebreathing, Mana Production, Land and Artifact Destruction, Combat, Card Drawing", "Red looks on the world and sees adventure. Life is a chance to experience something - many things - and for Red, there is no more worthwhile endeavor than to enjoy life by the adventure it offers. Experiences are what life is about, and to appreciate the full range of life's experiences, Red lives by emotion. What makes one laugh, what makes one cry, what one hates and what one loves, these make up what a person is. A person can look only to these, believes Red, to find one's wishes and desires in life. Deny these, and life is meaningless.");
